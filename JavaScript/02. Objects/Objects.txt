// Objects

Objects can be declared in two ways :-
1. Literals - Not Singleton, multiple instances of an object.
// Implementation :
const obj = {
  name : "Himanshu",                  // By default Babel treats key as string literals i.e. name as "name", age as "age"
  age : 22
}

2. Constructor - Singleton, only one copy of an object.
// Implementation
const obj = Object.create(null)

There are two ways to access keys and value inside an object :-
const obj = {
  name : "Himanshu Oli",
  age : 22,
  comitted : false
}
1. console.log(obj.name)                     // Dot notation is more concise and easier to read.
2. console.log(obj["name"])                  // Bracket notation is more versatile.

Note : One difference between dot notation and bracket notation -
const obj = {
  "full name" : "Himanshu Oli",
  age : 22,
  uid : "21BCS7367"
}
console.log(obj.full name)                 // Cannot access using dot notation
console.log(obj["full name"])              // Correct Way
