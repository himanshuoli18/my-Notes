// this - refer to current context

Earlier Javascript only runs on browser. On browser, Window object is the global object. So that's why it shows Window object when we look on browser.
Now a days, we can run JavaScript stand alone. So, in node environment 'this' refer to {} empty object. So that's why it shows {} empty object when we look on console.

const user = {
    name : "Himanshu Oli",
    price : 1999,
    welcomeMessage : function() {
        console.log(`Welcome ${this.name}!`);
        console.log(this)
    }
} 

user.welcomeMessage()
user.name = "Mansi Oli"
user.welcomeMessage()

console.log(this)

// Note :- We can only use 'this' keyword inside objects, not inside functions.
